[2023-04-19 16:19:59.862] [jointLog] [warning] salmon was only able to assign 8 fragments to transcripts in the index, but the minimum number of required assigned fragments (--minAssignedFrags) was 10. This could be indicative of a mismatch between the reference and sample, or a very bad sample.  You can change the --minAssignedFrags parameter to force salmon to quantify with fewer assigned fragments (must have at least 1).
